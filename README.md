# adlerbot1

Welcome to the Adlerbot1 project, a node.js web application featuring a chatbot designed to provide an interactive user experience. This application includes a chatbot with an input area for users to type their messages and a response area that automatically scrolls to display all the interactions. The chatbot's functionality is powered by a server-side API developed in C# and .NET Core 8, ensuring efficient processing and response to user inputs.

## Project Structure

- `chatbot-ui`: Contains the front-end code for the chatbot, including the input and response areas. The response area is designed to implement scrolling to ensure all messages are visible to the user.
- `server-api`: Houses the C# and .NET Core 8 server-side API code that services the chat requests from the front end. This directory includes all necessary configurations and controllers to handle chat interactions effectively.

This project aims to provide a seamless and engaging chat experience, leveraging the latest technologies in web development and server-side processing.
